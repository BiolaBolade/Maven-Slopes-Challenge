## Introduction
Skiing is a recreational activity, basic transport, and winter sport. With the overly number of ski resorts around the world, it might be so tiring for families planning a holiday experience or individual skiers to get their desired ski resorts. My aim is to build an interactive and informative dashboard that will help skiers around the world find the perfect ski resorts for their location, budget, and skill level.

##Dataset
Two data sets were provided by Maven Analytics for the #mavenslopeschallenge. The first dataset is the resort dataset which contains information about 499 ski resorts in the world, while the second dataset which is the snow data set is filled with details about the snow coverage across different regions in a year.

## Critical Thinking

To build an informative and interactive dashboard for this project, I made the necessary research because I needed to understand the basic requirements of skier would consider before choosing a ski resort and these are:

1. A skier would most definitely choose a ski resort according to their budget (€), and country of choice.

2. Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced-level skiers would likely consider ski resorts that are of best fit for their skill level because there are ski resorts that have equipment and facilities for different levels of skiing.

3. Most skiers would also want to check out the snow coverage before going for a skiing experience.

4. Skiers would also check out for some special features needed for their comfortability and smooth skiing experience before choosing a resort.

## Approach

After understanding what a skier might consider before choosing a ski resort, I used these key characteristics to create an interactive dashboard.

*Tools Used: MS Excel & Power BI*

**A breakdown of the visualization is listed below:**

- ***Key points:*** Being at the top of the dashboard, I used this visual to showcase some key points skiers might need to know about the dataset.

- ***Ski resorts across different countries:*** Skiers can quickly navigate through this visual to check the desired countries with the number of resorts each country has. Austria, France, and the United States are the best choice when checking out for countries with the highest number of resorts.

- ***Ski resorts according to your budget (€):*** The most expensive ski resort is Beaver Creek with an entry pass fee of €141. However, do not worry if that is above your budget, here are numerous ski resorts that will suit your budget perfectly. Also, there are resorts with free entry pass for those looking to try out ski resorts without spending a dime.

- ***Special features of ski resorts:*** Skiing is a super fun exercise, and it is great for keeping children, happy and also enhances cardiovascular health. Parents should be rest assured of the safety of their children as 99% of these resorts are child-friendly. Seventy-six (76%) percent of ski resorts have snow parks that are made for skilled skiers and snowboarders who enjoy performing tricks. Also, 59% of these resorts offer night skiing for skiers who want to ski after sundown while 94% of these resorts offer summer skiing.

- ***The best time to go skiing:*** Whether you are a family looking for a festive feel or a skier who wants to cover some miles, check out this guide to pick the time that suits you. The best time to go skiing is between late December and early April which is the main season in most resorts as a result of the high snow coverage during these months.

**Dashboard**

I created the dashboard below to help skiers explore ski resorts clarify based on their budget, preferred destination, travel month(s)/season, and preferred amenities, among others.
